      The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India.
       It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft
       at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than
       females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides.
      A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The lion is a muscular, deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced
      neck and round ears. Its fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey,
      yellowish red and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter.
      A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood
      although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts. </p>
